                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1986</strong> - Ruit and Fred Hollows developed a strategy for using inexpensive
                        intraocular lenses to bring small-incision cataract surgery to the developing world.</li>
                    <li><strong>1994</strong> - Ruit and The Fred Hollows Foundation founded the Tilganga Eye Center,
                        now called the Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, in Kathmandu. Tilganga has performed over
                        90,000 operations and trained over 500 medical personnel from around the world, and produces
                        Ruit's intraocular lenses at a cost of less than US$5 each. It also produces prosthetic eyes for
                        US$3, compared to imports that cost $150.</li>
                    <li><strong>1995</strong> - Ruit developed a new intraocular lens that could be produced far more
                        cheaply.</li>
                    <li><strong>2006</strong> - After treating a North Korean diplomat in Kathmandu, Ruit persuaded
                        North Korean authorities to let him visit.There he conducted surgery on 1000 patients and
                        trained many local surgeons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Also,</strong> - For those unable to reach the Center, or who live in otherwise isolated
                        rural areas, Ruit and his team set up mobile eye camps, often using tents, classrooms, and even
                        animal stables as makeshift operating rooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Also,</strong> - Out of the Darkness, a 2011 film by Italian director Stefano Levi,
                        documents Ruit's work in remote Northern Nepal.</li>
